  Minecraft Unofficial Server Installer 

Hello, Welcome to the Unofficial Minecraft Server Installer!
============================================================

If you use windows: you have to use the python installer and for that you have to have java and python 3 installed.
BUT if YOU use LINUX/FEDORA/CENTOS... You can use the code in the UNIX Folder. It is 1 .sh file AND you don't even have to have anything pre-installed!
It will install all depends for you so it needs your password
Thanks For Using the unofficial super fast server installer!
============================================================
YOU MUST HAVE AN INTERNET CONNECTION!!!
