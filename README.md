  Minecraft Unofficial Server Installer 

Hello, Welcome to the Unofficial Minecraft Server Installer!
============================================================

If you use windows: you have to use the python installer and for that you have to have java and python 3 installed. BUT if YOU use LINUX/FEDORA/CENTOS... You can use the code in the UNIX Folder. It is 1 .sh file.
